#Title:
Skin Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

##Team Members
Aavya Srivastava, Reagan Smiley

##Project Description
Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer globally, with early detection significantly impacting patient outcomes. Leveraging deep learning techniques, this project aims to develop a model for automated skin cancer detection from dermatoscopic images. The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset contains many high-quality images annotated by dermatologists, which we will use as our primary data source. By training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on this dataset, the goal is to create a system capable of accurately classifying skin lesions as either benign or malignant. To achieve this, the project will explore various parameters such as learning rate, batch size, activation functions, and dropout rates, optimizing the model's performance through rigorous experimentation. With this project, we aim to advance the field of dermatology by providing a reliable and accessible tool for early detection, potentially saving lives and reducing healthcare costs.
